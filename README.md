REFERENCE OF CODE NAVIGATION



for script.js organized in this manner:
the functional logic specific to the website (like the switch functionality) remains at the top, while the more cosmetic effects (like the Matrix animation) are towards the bottom.



ADVICE/REFERENCE FOR FUTURE WEBSITE PROJECT:

Single Script Across Multiple Pages:

If you're using one script.js for multiple HTML pages, make sure to check whether specific elements exist before trying to access or modify them.



Checking for Element Existence:

Before accessing an element's properties or methods, ensure the element exists to avoid null reference errors.

javascript 
var element = document.querySelector(".element-class");
if (element) {
    // Do something with the element
}

Modular Approach:

Consider splitting your JavaScript code into functions or modules. This way, you can call only the relevant functions based on the current page, avoiding unnecessary code execution.
Specific Scripts:


Add Event Listeners Carefully:

If you're adding event listeners, ensure the target element exists. Otherwise, the script will throw an error when it can't find the element.
Consider Frameworks or Libraries:

If your project grows in complexity, consider using frameworks or libraries like React, Vue, or Angular. These offer more structured ways to handle page-specific logic and components.
